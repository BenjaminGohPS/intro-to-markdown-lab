So you have been riding for a while, and you woke up one day and decided "Hey, I need a new bike!'. Or perhaps you have become fitter, and found that the only thing holding you back from being even faster is the bicycle, then you have come to the right place while doing your research for a new bicycle. Here are some consideration to assist in your decision making before you shell out those hard earn monies!

## 1. Reasons(a.k.a. excuses) for getting a new bicycle

```
"I need a new bike to stay motivated," says Tom.
```

Reasons listed below are non-exhaustive, so mix and match them, and may you, and your other half find peace with your reasons.

1. This bike will make me go faster!
1. All my friends have gotten a new bike, so I shall too.
1. I am trying out a new discipline, so different tools, for different purpose.
1. The store is having an unbelivable discount.
1. As least my hobby is healthy.

> Tip: Having a group of friends who can validate your claims will make the reasons/excuses more believable!

## 2. Choosing the type of bicycle

Now that you have convince yourself and/or your other half with your _"reasons"_. It's time to chose your new shiny toy! However, do note that certain bikes are not compatible for certain disipline. It may lead to injuries, accidents, or worse, bruising of your **EGO**! You have been warned!

### Example:

```
Using a foldable bike (i.e. foldy) while your cycling buddies are on their slick, and aerodynamic time-trial bikes, will lead to severe brusing of ego as you try to keep up to their pace.
```

## 3. Sizing

**SIZE** does matter. I mean the size of your bike. Getting one that doesn't fit you will cause the individual to feel uncomfortable on rides, inability to control and handle the bike well, and may even lead to injuries or accidents

### Example:

```
Buying a brand new roadbike just because it's on discount, without considering the sizing, will be outright silly.
```

Would advise to visit your nearest local bike store, or go for bike fit for a better experience.
